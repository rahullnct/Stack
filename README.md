🧱 Stack Data Structure
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The element added last is the one to be removed first, just like a stack of plates.

🧐 What is a Stack?
A stack is a collection of elements with two main operations:

Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.

Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.

It supports operations at only one end — the top.

📌 LIFO Principle:

Copy
Edit
Bottom [1, 2, 3, 4] Top
Push(5) → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Pop()   → [1, 2, 3, 4]
⚙️ Stack Operations
Operation	Description
push()	Inserts an element
pop()	Removes the top element
peek() / top()	Returns top element without removing
isEmpty()	Checks if stack is empty
size()	Returns the size of stack

🚀 Applications
Function call/recursion management

Undo mechanisms in editors

Expression evaluation (infix to postfix)

Syntax parsing

Backtracking (e.g., maze, puzzle solving)

🛠️ Implementation
This repository contains stack implementations in:

✅ Array-based stack

✅ Linked list-based stack

✅ Language: Python / C++ / Java (you can mention based on what you used)

💡 Code Examples
python
Copy
Edit
# Python example
stack = []
stack.append(10)  # Push
stack.append(20)
print(stack.pop())  # Pop → 20
🧪 How to Run
Clone this repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stack-data-structure.git
cd stack-data-structure
Run the implementation:

bash
Copy
Edit
python stack_array.py
Or, if in C++:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ stack.cpp -o stack
./stack
